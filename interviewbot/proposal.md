# Project Proposal: AI-Powered Process Flow Diagram Generator

## Project Overview

### Project Name:
AI-Powered Process Flow Diagram Generator

### Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop an AI system capable of automatically generating process flow diagrams based on unstructured data sources, such as emails, manuals, and ERP logs. The system will utilize large language models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Agentic AI to create accurate and insightful visualizations of business processes.

### Key Deliverables:
1. **LLM Integration**: Leverage large language models (e.g., GPT) to extract relevant information from unstructured data and understand underlying business processes.
2. **RAG Integration**: Enhance the model's capabilities by integrating external knowledge sources to improve accuracy.
3. **Agentic AI**: Use autonomous agents to assist in data preprocessing and refinement of the process flow diagrams.
4. **Diagram Generation Engine**: Translate the extracted information into clear process flow diagrams using automated diagram generation tools.
5. **Basic User Interface**: A simple interface allowing users to upload documents, view the generated diagrams, and make adjustments as needed.

## Background and Motivation

### Problem Statement:
Organizations deal with vast amounts of unstructured data in the form of emails, manuals, and logs, which often contain valuable information about business processes. Manually extracting and visualizing this information is time-consuming and prone to errors. By utilizing large language models, RAG, and Agentic AI, we can automate this task and improve efficiency and accuracy in process documentation.

### Proposed Solution:
We propose to develop an AI-powered system that uses large language models (LLMs) to extract process-related information from unstructured data. The system will automatically generate process flow diagrams that can be reviewed and adjusted by users.

## Technical Approach

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
- **Data Sources**: Gather unstructured data such as emails, manuals, and ERP logs.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Use Agentic AI to automate tasks like cleaning, structuring, and preparing the data for use by the LLMs.

### 2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- **Knowledge Integration**: Integrate external knowledge sources with the LLM to enhance the model's ability to understand and extract relevant process information.
  
### 3. Diagram Generation
- **Flowchart Logic**: Define rules and algorithms to automatically translate the extracted process information into visual process flow diagrams.
- **Diagram Rendering**: Use tools such as Graphviz or Mermaid to generate the diagrams from the data.

## Project Timeline and Budget

### Phase 1: Research and Data Collection (Weeks 1-2)
- **Hours Estimate**: 40 hours
  - Collect and preprocess unstructured data (e.g., emails, manuals, ERP logs).
  - Set up Agentic AI to assist with data cleaning and structuring.

### Phase 2: LLM and RAG Integration (Weeks 3-5)
- **Hours Estimate**: 80 hours
  - Integrate LLMs to extract process information from the unstructured data.
  - Implement RAG to enhance the model's accuracy with external knowledge sources.

### Phase 3: Diagram Generation Engine (Weeks 6-10)
- **Hours Estimate**: 100 hours
  - Develop the logic for converting extracted information into process flow diagrams.
  - Implement tools for rendering diagrams using libraries like Graphviz or PlantUML.

### **Total Estimated Hours**: 220 hours

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| **Risk**                                 | **Mitigation Strategy**                         |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Inaccurate extraction of process flows   | Continuously improve the LLM through iterative feedback and testing. |
| Complexity in diagram generation         | Use modular logic to simplify the diagram generation process. |
| User adoption and usability              | Build a basic yet functional user interface for easy interaction with the system. |

## Conclusion

The AI-Powered Process Flow Diagram Generator will automate the extraction of process flows from unstructured data sources, helping organizations visualize and document their business processes more efficiently. By leveraging LLMs, RAG, and Agentic AI, this project will provide students with hands-on experience in cutting-edge AI technologies while delivering valuable insights to organizations.
