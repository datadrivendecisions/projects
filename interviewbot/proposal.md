# Project Proposal 2: Real-Time Interview Assistant for ARBO Compliance Reporting and Long-Term Analysis

## Project Overview
This project proposes the development of an AI-powered real-time interview assistant using Machine Learning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Agentic AI to ensure ARBO (Dutch Occupational Health and Safety Act) compliance during employee interviews. The system will provide live guidance during interviews, assist in generating compliance reports, and support long-term trend analysis to enhance workplace safety and health management.

### Objectives
- Develop an AI-driven real-time assistant that provides live feedback and suggestions during interviews, leveraging RAG for enhanced context.
- Automate the generation of ARBO-compliant reports.
- Implement a long-term analysis tool to identify trends and suggest improvements in workplace safety, using Agentic AI to continuously refine insights.

### Scope

#### 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
- **Data Sources**: Collect historical interview data, ARBO compliance records, and safety-related documentation.
- **Agentic AI for Data Preprocessing**: Automate text cleaning, annotation, and preprocessing using autonomous agents for better accuracy and efficiency.
- **RAG Integration**: Utilize RAG to integrate external compliance knowledge and contextual ARBO regulations, enabling the system to stay up-to-date.

#### 2. Model Development
- **NLP and Machine Learning**: Develop an NLP-based model that can analyze interview content in real-time, detecting ARBO-related compliance concerns.
- **Real-Time Suggestion System**: Implement a live feedback system, prompting interviewers with compliance-related questions or concerns based on RAG-enhanced knowledge retrieval.
- **Reporting Engine**: Automate the generation of ARBO-compliant reports immediately after interviews, incorporating Agentic AI to improve report accuracy over time.

#### 3. System Integration
- **Integration with HR & Compliance Systems**: Seamlessly integrate the AI assistant with existing HR systems and compliance software to simplify data flow and report generation.
- **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface for interviewers, allowing them to interact with the assistant, receive real-time guidance, and review compliance reports.

#### 4. Long-Term Trend Analysis
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Implement a trend analysis tool that continuously monitors interview data and identifies patterns related to workplace safety and health compliance.
- **Agentic AI for Analysis**: Deploy autonomous agents to track patterns and refine safety insights, suggesting improvements and proactively identifying potential compliance issues.

#### 5. Testing & Validation
- **Pilot Testing**: Conduct live pilot tests during interviews to assess the performance of the real-time assistant.
- **Validation**: Ensure the accuracy of the generated ARBO-compliant reports and the relevance of the assistant's real-time suggestions through compliance expert validation.

## Project Timeline and Budget

- **Hours Estimate**: 120 hours
  - Collect and preprocess historical interview and compliance data using Agentic AI for annotation and cleaning.
  - Begin developing the core NLP model for real-time content analysis.

### Phase 2: Real-Time Assistant Development and System Integration (Month 3-4)
- **Hours Estimate**: 160 hours
  - Implement RAG to enhance the AI's understanding of ARBO compliance.
  - Develop the real-time suggestion engine and integrate it with HR and compliance systems.
  - Build the user interface for real-time interaction during interviews.

### Phase 3: Long-Term Trend Analysis and Model Refinement (Month 5-6)
- **Hours Estimate**: 120 hours
  - Develop the long-term analysis tool to track safety trends using interview data.
  - Refine the model based on pilot feedback and ensure the analysis tool is effective in identifying actionable insights.

### Phase 4: Testing, Validation, and Deployment (Month 7)
- **Hours Estimate**: 80 hours
  - Test the system in real-world interview scenarios.
  - Validate report generation accuracy and the effectiveness of the real-time assistant through compliance expert review.
  - Deploy the final system and provide training to HR teams.

### **Total Estimated Hours**: 480 hours

## Resources Needed
- **Data Scientists**: For NLP model development, RAG integration, and long-term trend analysis (200 hours).
- **Software Engineers**: For real-time system development, user interface creation, and integration with HR systems (180 hours).
- **Compliance Experts**: To annotate data and validate the system's ARBO compliance performance (60 hours).
- **HR Professionals**: To provide feedback and test the real-time assistant in live scenarios (40 hours).

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| **Risk**                                 | **Mitigation Strategy**                          |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Incomplete or biased training data**    | Collaborate with ARBO experts to annotate and validate training data for compliance coverage. |
| **Accuracy of real-time suggestions**     | Continuously refine the NLP model and RAG system based on pilot testing and feedback from users. |
| **Integration challenges with HR systems**| Start integration planning early, and engage with HR teams and software vendors to ensure compatibility. |
| **User adoption and interface usability** | Conduct thorough usability testing with HR teams to ensure that the system is intuitive and meets user expectations. |
| **Long-term trend analysis reliability**  | Utilize Agentic AI to continually monitor and refine trend analysis, incorporating new data to improve system accuracy. |

## Expected Outcomes
- **Real-Time Interview Assistant**: An AI assistant that ensures ARBO compliance during interviews by providing live feedback and suggestions.
- **Automated Reporting**: A reporting engine that generates accurate, ARBO-compliant reports in real-time, reducing manual work and errors.
- **Long-Term Analysis**: A trend analysis tool that identifies patterns in interview data, offering actionable insights and proactive recommendations for improving workplace safety and health.
