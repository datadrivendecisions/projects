## Project Proposal 2: Real-Time Interview Assistant for ARBO Compliance Reporting and Long-Term Analysis

### Project Overview
This project proposes the development of a real-time interview assistant powered by Machine Learning to ensure ARBO (Dutch Occupational Health and Safety Act) compliance during employee interviews. The system will provide live guidance during interviews, assist in generating compliance reports, and facilitate long-term trend analysis to support workplace safety and health management.

### Objectives
- Develop an ML-driven assistant that provides real-time feedback and suggestions during interviews.
- Automate the generation of ARBO-compliant reports.
- Implement a long-term analysis tool to identify trends and suggest improvements in workplace safety.

### Scope

#### Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Collect historical interview data and ARBO compliance records.
- Annotate data to train the ML model for recognizing compliance-related issues.

#### Model Development
- Develop an NLP model to understand and analyze interview content in real-time.
- Implement a real-time suggestion system that prompts interviewers with compliance-related questions or concerns.
- Create a reporting engine that generates ARBO-compliant documentation immediately after interviews.

#### System Integration
- Integrate the ML model with existing HR and compliance software.
- Develop a user-friendly interface for interviewers to interact with the assistant.

#### Long-Term Analysis
- Implement a trend analysis tool that identifies patterns in interview data related to workplace safety and health.
- Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on long-term data analysis.

#### Testing & Validation
- Conduct pilot tests in live interview scenarios to assess the performance of the real-time assistant.
- Validate the accuracy of the generated reports and the relevance of real-time suggestions.

### Timeline
- **Phase 1 (Month 1-2):** Data collection, preprocessing, and initial model development.
- **Phase 2 (Month 3-4):** Real-time assistant development and system integration.
- **Phase 3 (Month 5-6):** Long-term analysis tool development and model refinement.
- **Phase 4 (Month 7):** Testing, validation, and final deployment.

### Resources Needed
- Data scientists with expertise in NLP, real-time systems, and compliance.
- ARBO experts for compliance validation and model training.
- Software engineers for system integration and interface development.
- HR professionals for testing and feedback on the real-time assistant.

### Expected Outcomes
- A real-time interview assistant that ensures ARBO compliance during interviews.
- Automated ARBO-compliant reporting, reducing manual effort and errors.
- Insights into long-term trends, supporting proactive measures in workplace safety and health.
