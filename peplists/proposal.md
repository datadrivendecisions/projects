# Project Proposal: Generative AI-Enhanced PEP List Compliance Monitoring System

## Project Overview

### Project Name:
Generative AI-Enhanced PEP List Compliance Monitoring System

### Objective:
The project aims to develop a Generative AI (GenAI) solution to enhance the monitoring and compliance checking of Politically Exposed Persons (PEP) lists. The system will automate the cross-referencing of client data with PEP lists, generate risk assessments and summaries, and provide compliance officers with actionable insights. This project will focus on developing a core solution within 2.5 months.

### Key Deliverables:
1. **GenAI Model**: A GenAI model capable of cross-referencing client data with PEP lists, understanding complex name variations, and generating risk assessments.
2. **Summarization and Risk Assessment Tool**: A generative tool that produces concise, human-readable summaries and risk assessments for flagged individuals.
3. **Reporting and Visualization Dashboard**: A user-friendly interface displaying GenAI-generated summaries, risks, and recommendations.

## Background and Motivation

### Problem Statement:
Monitoring and ensuring compliance with PEP regulations is critical for financial institutions to avoid legal risks and reputational damage. Traditional methods of cross-referencing client data with PEP lists are labor-intensive and prone to errors. There is a need for an automated AI-driven solution that can streamline this process while providing real-time insights and risk assessments.

### Proposed Solution:
This project will create a Generative AI-powered system that automates the cross-referencing of client data against PEP lists, generates real-time risk assessments, and produces concise summaries to support decision-making. The system will use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve accuracy by integrating external knowledge sources.

## Technical Approach

### 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
- **Data Sources**: Collect and preprocess data from PEP lists, including government databases and financial institutions.
- **Data Normalization**: Standardize the data to ensure seamless integration across multiple sources.

### 2. GenAI Model Development
- **Cross-Referencing Model**: Use an LLM-based approach to match client data with PEP lists, handling name variations and aliases.
- **Risk Assessment and Summarization**: Implement a generative tool to produce human-readable summaries and risk assessments based on flagged data.

### 3. System Integration and Dashboard
- **Dashboard Development**: Create a user-friendly interface for compliance officers to view real-time risk assessments and summaries.
- **RAG for Enhanced Context**: Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation to integrate external data sources, ensuring accurate and context-aware risk assessments.

## Project Timeline and Budget

### Phase 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing (Weeks 1-2)
- **Hours Estimate**: 40 hours
  - Collect and preprocess PEP list data.
  - Standardize the data for seamless integration into the GenAI model.

### Phase 2: GenAI Model Development (Weeks 3-5)
- **Hours Estimate**: 80 hours
  - Develop the core GenAI model for cross-referencing client data with PEP lists.
  - Implement the risk assessment and summarization components.

### Phase 3: Dashboard Development and System Integration (Weeks 6-10)
- **Hours Estimate**: 100 hours
  - Develop a user-friendly dashboard for displaying risk assessments and summaries.
  - Integrate the GenAI model and ensure real-time data processing capabilities.

### **Total Estimated Hours**: 220 hours

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| **Risk**                                 | **Mitigation Strategy**                          |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Incomplete or inaccurate PEP data        | Partner with reputable PEP data providers and regularly update the data. |
| Model accuracy and false positives       | Continuously refine the GenAI model based on feedback from users and testing. |
| Integration challenges                   | Engage early with compliance software vendors to ensure smooth integration. |
| User adoption and interface usability    | Conduct usability testing to ensure the dashboard meets user needs. |

## Expected Outcomes
- A Generative AI-enhanced PEP compliance monitoring system that automates and improves the accuracy of cross-referencing client data with PEP lists.
- Real-time risk assessments and summaries that provide compliance officers with actionable insights.
- A reporting dashboard that simplifies compliance management and decision-making.
